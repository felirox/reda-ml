Mistakes of violating social distancing are often committed without consciousness. 
It is very much required to look for a feasible method to deal with the same by employing a bot to monitor the social distancing and spread awareness among the human community. 

# OBJECTIVES:

● To create a Conversational Robot which can interact with people through Speech (NLP).

● A robot that can warn people when Social Distancing is not maintained -Using openCV and implementing YOLO to train a program to detect if
Social Distancing is being followed.

● The concept of sending out a mini Robot which can travel to that designated place and read out a warning to them to follow Social
Distancing.

● Training the Robot using Dialog Flow to reply to people’s queries and search and give the necessary answer required.

● The trained conversational chatbot is implemented with Google Assistant so that people can converse with the bot to get the necessary
information/report something at the ease of their hand.

● To create a website for the robot where users are given access to all the recorded data about violation of physical distancing.

● The authentication of the users to log onto the website is handled by Auth0.

● The website has a histogram showing the count of violations everyday and a gallery to display the images captured by the robot while
monitoring.

● A table created on the website lists all the suspects and their details reported by the users to the chatbot.

# Key Deliverables:
● An autonomous conversational robot pre-programmed to help humans with their queries.

● Almost any query related to the COVID pandemic can be conversed.

● The robot can detect humans and see whether social distancing is being followed.

● Robots can take in feedback from humans to improve environmental conditions.

● Humans can report a suspect and the same will be forwarded to the authorities asap.

● Robots can be summoned through Google Assistant on their phones when the robot is not in their vicinity. The GA AI bot can provide essential information about the current COVID status. The suspect report can also be conducted.


# Validity of Concept:
● It is possible with AI to monitor physical distancing using YOLO, a fully convolutional neural network.

● It is also possible to Recognise voice and understand the user query and respond accordingly, as per trained by the developer.

● Integrating these two features onto a Robot structure, with necessary embedded systems, for movement of the bot, can serve in the places such as entrances, etc.
